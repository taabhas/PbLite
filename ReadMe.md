# Probability-based Edge Detection

This project showcases a simplified implementation of the Probability of Boundary (Pb) algorithm that advances beyond traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection techniques. By incorporating texture and color discontinuities alongside intensity discontinuities, the Pb algorithm achieves superior edge detection accuracy.
The implementation is detailed in Phase1.ipynb and accompanied by a comprehensive report that explains the methodology, tools, and libraries used.

### Results
The information from the texture, color and brightness features is combined with a baseline method (based on Sobel or Canny edge detection or an average of both).
